# Unmapped Spotify Listens Tool

This is a web-based tool that fetches **unmapped listens** from ListenBrainz that were submitted via Spotify. The tool helps users find tracks that are not yet mapped to MusicBrainz and provides links to search for the track in MusicBrainz, go directly to the Spotify album of the submitted track, and submit the album to Harmony.
